# Data Commons

[![CI](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/datacommons/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/datacommons/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

Data Commons is an open source semantic graph database for modeling, querying, and analyzing interconnected data.

Data Commons powers [datacommons.org](https://datacommons.org), Google's open knowledge graph that connects public data across domains like demographics, economics, health, and education.

## Getting Started

* **Deploying or operating a DCP instance?** If you are an instance owner, data steward, or administrator looking to install and run your own Data Commons instance, follow the **[Data Commons Platform User Guide](docs/user_guide.md)**.
* **Developing or contributing to the codebase?** If you are an engineer contributing to DCP, start with the hands-on **[Developer Onboarding Codelab](docs/codelabs/dcp_developer_onboarding.md)** for a guided tutorial deploying and testing an instance, consult the **[Developer Guide](docs/developer_guide.md)** for workbench recipes and monorepo topology, and review **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for pull request guidelines.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.11 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (Python project manager)
- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with Cloud Spanner enabled
- A Cloud Spanner instance and database (using Google Standard SQL) for storing the knowledge graph

## Deploying Data Commons Platform In GCP

Use the CLI to scaffold a Terraform deployment directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datacommonsorg/datacommons
cd datacommons/
uv run datacommons admin init
```

The command will prompt for:
- GCP project id
- Instance name
- Data Commons API key

It then creates a new folder with `main.tf`, `terraform.tfvars`, and a deployment `README.md`.

From the generated folder:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Once infrastructure is deployed, initialize the database and trigger data ingestion using the CLI.

You can run these commands directly from your Terraform deployment directory (where state outputs are detected automatically), or from anywhere by passing the `--project-id` and `--instance-name` flags:

#### Option A: Run from your Terraform directory
```bash
# Run from inside your deployment folder (e.g. cd prod/)
uv run datacommons admin init-db

# Trigger data ingestion
uv run datacommons admin ingest start --imports <import_name>
```

#### Option B: Run from anywhere (Remote GCS State)
```bash
# Run from any directory or CI/CD runner without local Terraform files
uv run datacommons admin --project-id my-gcp-project --instance-name prod init-db

# Trigger data ingestion
uv run datacommons admin --project-id my-gcp-project --instance-name prod ingest start --imports <import_name>
```

## Documentation & Guides

### User Documentation (DCP Instance Owners and Administrators)

If you are an instance owner, data steward, or administrator looking to install, configure, and manage a Data Commons instance:
